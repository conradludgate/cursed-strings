/// Converts a slice of bytes to a string slice.
///
/// A string slice ([`&str`]) is made of bytes ([`u8`]), and a byte slice
/// ([`&[u8]`][byteslice]) is made of bytes, so this function converts between
/// the two. Not all byte slices are valid string slices, however: [`&str`] requires
/// that it is valid UTF-8. `from_utf8()` checks to ensure that the bytes are valid
/// UTF-8, and then does the conversion.
///
/// [`&str`]: crate::str
/// [byteslice]: slice
///
/// If you are sure that the byte slice is valid UTF-8, and you don't want to
/// incur the overhead of the validity check, there is an unsafe version of
/// this function, [`from_utf8_unchecked`], which has the same
/// behavior but skips the check.
///
/// If you need a `String` instead of a `&str`, consider
/// [`String::from_utf8`][string].
///
/// [string]: StringBase::from_utf8
///
/// Because you can stack-allocate a `[u8; N]`, and you can take a
/// [`&[u8]`][byteslice] of it, this function is one way to have a
/// stack-allocated string. There is an example of this in the
/// examples section below.
///
/// [byteslice]: slice
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns `Err` if the slice is not UTF-8 with a description as to why the
/// provided slice is not UTF-8.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Basic usage:
///
/// ```
/// # use cursed_strings::str;
/// // some bytes, in a vector
/// let sparkle_heart = vec![240, 159, 146, 150];
///
/// // We know these bytes are valid, so just use `unwrap()`.
/// let sparkle_heart = cursed_strings::from_utf8(&sparkle_heart).unwrap();
///
/// assert_eq!(sparkle_heart, <&str>::from("ðŸ’–"));
/// ```
///
/// Incorrect bytes:
///
/// ```
/// // some invalid bytes, in a vector
/// let sparkle_heart = vec![0, 159, 146, 150];
///
/// assert!(cursed_strings::from_utf8(&sparkle_heart).is_err());
/// ```
